This web Application collects user data like First Name, Last Name , Email . 
I Have Made this using Mailchimp API.
To Run this,  first Download the code and we need to have node, express, body-parser, request, already installed and then run the app.js file using node or nodemon.
I have also published this website using heroku so it can be acccessed from anywhere.
